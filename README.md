# Devonz

Devonz was originally buildt on from the amazing repository [bolt.diy](https://bolt.diy/), which you can check out for more information about the original project. As for why i decided to create Devonz is simple the current project bolt.diy seems to have been inactive for a long time (atleast in the time when thinking about ai), i wanted to continue the development of this amazing project, but also i wanted to make it more specilised for speed with less files

1. **Open Settings**: Click the settings icon (⚙️) in the sidebar to access the settings panel
2. **Navigate to Providers**: Select the "Providers" tab from the settings menu
3. **Choose Provider Type**: Switch between "Cloud Providers" and "Local Providers" tabs

### Cloud Providers Configuration

The Cloud Providers tab displays all cloud-based AI services in an organized card layout:

#### Adding API Keys

1. **Select Provider**: Browse the grid of available cloud providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
2. **Toggle Provider**: Use the switch to enable/disable each provider
3. **Set API Key**:
   - Click the provider card to expand its configuration
   - Click on the "API Key" field to enter edit mode
   - Paste your API key and press Enter to save
   - The interface shows real-time validation with green checkmarks for valid keys

#### Advanced Features

- **Bulk Toggle**: Use "Enable All Cloud" to toggle all cloud providers at once
- **Visual Status**: Green checkmarks indicate properly configured providers
- **Provider Icons**: Each provider has a distinctive icon for easy identification
- **Descriptions**: Helpful descriptions explain each provider's capabilities

### Local Providers Configuration

The Local Providers tab manages local AI installations and custom endpoints:

#### Ollama Configuration

1. **Enable Ollama**: Toggle the Ollama provider switch
2. **Configure Endpoint**: Set the API endpoint (defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:11434`)
3. **Model Management**:
   - View all installed models with size and parameter information
   - Update models to latest versions with one click
   - Delete unused models
   - Install new models by entering model names

#### Other Local Providers

- **LM Studio**: Configure custom base URLs for LM Studio endpoints
- **OpenAI-like**: Connect to any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint
- **Auto-detection**: The system automatically detects environment variables for base URLs

### Environment Variables vs UI Configuration

Devonz supports both methods for maximum flexibility:

#### Environment Variables (Recommended for Production)

Set API keys and base URLs in your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here

# Custom Base URLs
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434
LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:1234
```

#### UI-Based Configuration

- **Real-time Updates**: Changes take effect immediately
- **Secure Storage**: API keys are stored securely in browser cookies
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators show configuration status
- **Easy Management**: Edit, view, and manage keys through the interface

### Provider-Specific Features

#### OpenRouter

- **Free Models Filter**: Toggle to show only free models when browsing
- **Pricing Information**: View input/output costs for each model
- **Model Search**: Fuzzy search through all available models

#### Ollama

- **Model Installer**: Built-in interface to install new models
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time download progress for model updates
- **Model Details**: View model size, parameters, and quantization levels
- **Auto-refresh**: Automatically detects newly installed models

#### Search & Navigation

- **Fuzzy Search**: Type-ahead search across all providers and models
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Use arrow keys and Enter to navigate quickly
- **Clear Search**: Press `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux) to clear search

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

- **API Key Not Recognized**: Ensure you're using the correct API key format for each provider
- **Base URL Issues**: Verify the endpoint URL is correct and accessible
- **Model Not Loading**: Check that the provider is enabled and properly configured
- **Environment Variables Not Working**: Restart the application after adding new environment variables

#### Status Indicators

- 🟢 **Green Checkmark**: Provider properly configured and ready to use
- 🔴 **Red X**: Configuration missing or invalid
- 🟡 **Yellow Indicator**: Provider enabled but may need additional setup
- 🔵 **Blue Pencil**: Click to edit configuration

#### Local Providers

- **Ollama** - Run open-source models locally with advanced model management
- **LM Studio** - Local model inference with LM Studio
- **OpenAI-like** - Connect to any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint

> **💡 Pro Tip**: Start with OpenAI or Anthropic for the best results, then explore other providers based on your specific needs and budget considerations.

## Setup Using Git (For Developers only)

This method is recommended for developers who want to:

- Contribute to the project
- Stay updated with the latest changes
- Switch between different versions
- Create custom modifications

#### Prerequisites

1. Install Git: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

#### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone -b stable https://github.com/zebbern/Devonz.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Devonz
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

5. **(OPTIONAL)** Switch to the Main Branch if you want to use pre-release/testbranch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   pnpm install
   pnpm run dev
   ```
   Hint: Be aware that this can have beta-features and more likely got bugs than the stable release

> **Open the WebUI to test (Default: http://localhost:5173)**
>
> - Beginners:
>   - Try to use a sophisticated Provider/Model like Anthropic with Claude Sonnet 3.x Models to get best results
>   - Explanation: The System Prompt currently implemented in Devonz cant cover the best performance for all providers and models out there. So it works better with some models, then other, even if the models itself are perfect for >programming
>   - Future: Planned is a Plugin/Extentions-Library so there can be different System Prompts for different Models, which will help to get better results

#### Staying Updated

To get the latest changes from the repository:

1. **Save Your Local Changes** (if any):

   ```bash
   git stash
   ```

2. **Pull Latest Updates**:

   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

3. **Update Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Restore Your Local Changes** (if any):
   ```bash
   git stash pop
   ```

#### Troubleshooting Git Setup

If you encounter issues:

1. **Clean Installation**:

   ```bash
   # Remove node modules and lock files
   rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml

   # Clear pnpm cache
   pnpm store prune

   # Reinstall dependencies
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Reset Local Changes**:
   ```bash
   # Discard all local changes
   git reset --hard origin/main
   ```

Remember to always commit your local changes or stash them before pulling updates to avoid conflicts.
